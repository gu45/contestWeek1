    <div class="sec1">The beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much<br>larger foxhound. The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as<br>
    beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the<br>beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural<br>imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent<br>and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health<br>problems.</div>
